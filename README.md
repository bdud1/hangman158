# Hangman

## Description
Hangman is a classic game in which a player thinks of a word and the other player tries to guess that word within a certain amount of attempts.

This is an implementation of the Hangman game, where the computer thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it. 

## Aim of the Project
This is my first time doing a project in python. The aim of the project was to put everything I have learnt thus far into a singular project. It allowed me to practice defining classes and their attributes and methods, practice using different data structures and functions, as well as using git to log the progress.

## Installation Instructions
The project consists of milestone python files; however, the full working project is entirely contained in 'milestone_5.py' within the 'hangman158' directory.

## Usage Instructions
A word_list variable of the choice of words must be initialised.

## File Structure of the Project
The project contains multiple milestone_x.py files. Only 'milestone_5.py' is needed to run the code.
